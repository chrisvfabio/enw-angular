        Nordic Walking is relatively new to Australia but practised widely in Europe, the U.K. and the U.S.A. Its origins are in
        cross-country skiing, as the name suggests. It is a fitness activity utilising specially designed poles and a technique
        which activates 90% of the body’s muscles. It can be done on a variety of surfaces including footpaths, grass, sand
        and bush tracks.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is suitable for people of all ages and fitness levels as well as those living with chronic medical conditions. Before
        commencing any exercise program, it is advisable to get the go-ahead from a medical professional.

        As an instructor and regular Nordic Walker, I promote Nordic Walking as a way of keeping the brain healthy and reducing the
        risk of dementia. Learning Nordic Walking is simultaneously mentally, physically and socially stimulating. Activities
        that combine these 3 elements have been shown to be particularly beneficial for brain health.

        To obtain the benefits of Nordic Walking listed below, it is important to learn the correct technique from a qualified instructor.

        I am a keen Nordic Walker and have been instructing since 2011. In 2012, I worked as a Nordic Walking instructor with the
        City of Cockburn, running 2 groups for seniors as part of the Co-Health Program. Since 2009, I have run Heart Foundation
        Walking groups offering Nordic Walking.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently studying Preventive Health at the University of Notre Dame Australia at the Fremantle campus. Nordic Walking
        fits very well with my passion for brain health and reducing the risk of dementia. It involves cognitive stimulation,
        a physical workout and social interaction as it’s usually done in a group. Research shows that combining these 3
        components is beneficial for the brain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Essential Nordic Walking has been established to introduce Nordic Walking to as many West Australians as possible. My approach
        to Nordic Walking instruction is tailored to the individual needs of each client. For this reason, I teach in small
        groups of up to 6 walkers and I can cater for people of all ages and fitness levels. You will find me an outgoing
        and sociable person whose enthusiasm for Nordic Walking is motivating.
